Pressing a configurable hotkey (by default `Ctrl+Alt+A`) reveals **VimTab**:

* All listed tabs are in "most recently visited" order.

* On the left of each tab, a key (`0-9|a-z`) can be pressed to immediately swap to the desired tab. 

* One can press `/` to open the search box to filter tabs. 

This Vim-inspired navigation allows you to access *any* tab without ever utilizing mouse.

## How does this help me?

An example can be seen if bouncing between two tabs while having 50+ tabs opened. 

You can simply press `Hotkey+0` to immediately swap to the previous tab, and later press `Hotkey+0` to return to where you just were (because the tabs are ordered by "most recently visited" and the previously visited tab will be at location `0`).

This "tab history" functionality makes switching between all recent tabs near-instant. 

A second example can be seen if you have 50+ tabs opened and want to find your YouTube tab. 

Press `Hotkey`, then `/`, search `youtube`, and you can arrive at your YouTube tab in under a second... without touching your mouse!

This process should offer a *significant* workflow aid for speed users.
